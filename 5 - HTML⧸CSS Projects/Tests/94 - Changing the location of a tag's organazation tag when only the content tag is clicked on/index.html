    <!-- The trick for this is to give both the tag that we set as the trigger, And its organazation tag, The same class name, So the input is tricked into making 
    changes to both of them. -->
    <!-- But in order for you to be able to make unique changes to each tag, Be sure to give them their unique class name as well, And then apply the attributes to the 
    unique names. -->
