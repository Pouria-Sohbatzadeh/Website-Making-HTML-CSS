    <!-- In order to add the icon package to our HTML file, We first must open a path to the package's cdn files. -->

    <!-- And now for the icon itself. -->
    <!-- go to the website of the package (the website of font awsome in this case). -->
     <!-- Click on the icon tab, And then search for the icon you want. (Again be sure you set it to the right version) -->
    <!-- Click on the icon you want, And then choose the version you also want by clicking on its tabs. (It seems the different version do not work......) -->
    <!-- Then copy the tag along with its class name. -->
    <!-- Be sure to add the first words of the class name ("fa" in this case) as a unique class name as well, so this actually works. -->
    <!-- It gives an error without that unique class name -->
    <i class="fa fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i>


    <!-- Now this package's cdn file also has a java script asset file, So we must open a path to that as well. -->
    <!-- By puttiing the <scripts src=""> tag before the closing <body> tag. -->
    <!-- Then putting the address of the javaScript asset file in the quotes ("") of src="". (Be sure it's the 6.6.0 ver.) -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.6.0/js/all.min.js"></script>
