    <!-- Unlike writing, There's only one tag that allows us to put an image in the webage, That would be the <img src="" alt=""> Tag, In it we put the file name of of image
    and a text, The file name is placed in the quote of src, And the text, Which only appears if the image is not foundand can be used as a descriptive for the image, 
    , Is placed in the quote of alt. This is placed as an Inline element, Capable of being with other content in the same line, Granted the image has to be small enough. -->
