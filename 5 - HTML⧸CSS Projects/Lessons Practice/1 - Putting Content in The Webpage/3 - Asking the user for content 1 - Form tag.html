    <!-- There several tags that let us ask the user for content but the one that builds the foundation of it is the <form action="" method=""><form> tag, In it we Place the file
    name of an html and a special text, The former being Set as its destination when the user gives all their content, And the latter determining how the content is saved. There are
    two special texts that determine how. This tag is placed as a block element -->

    <!-- 1rst special text is the "get", Which saves the user's content in the web address, A good thing for tracking the place in the webpage, But horrible for saving
    user specific details. -->
    <!-- 2nd special text is post, Which saves the user's content in the body of the webpage. -->

    <form action="" method="<!-- get, or post-->">


    </form>
