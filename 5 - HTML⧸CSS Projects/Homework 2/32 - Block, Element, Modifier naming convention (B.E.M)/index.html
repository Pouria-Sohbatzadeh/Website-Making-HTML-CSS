    <!-- This is a demonstration of the BEM naming convention. -->
    <!-- First is the Block. Refering to tags that contain large parts of the webpage, The <section>, <form> tags and the like. -->
    <section class="box">
    <!-- Just given a normal class or id name. -->
    <!-- Or : Block -->


        <!-- Second is the Element, Refering mostly to content tags and the organazation tags that aren't included as Blocks. The <span>, <img>, <div>, <a> tags for example -->
        <span class="box__porpuse-of-existance">Shipment</span>
        <!-- It's named by first writing the class or id name of the Element's organazing Block, And the connecting the name of the Element with a double underscore (_). -->
        <!-- Or : Block__Element -->

        <!-- And at long last is the Modifier. Refering to the style attribute we want affecting the content. -->
        <span class="box__porpuse-of-existance--yellow">Shipment</span>
        <!-- It's written by first having the name of the Block, And Element class or id name before it, And then connecting the Modifier name with a double dash (-). -->
        <!--  or : Block__Element--Modifier -->

    </section>
    

    <!-- Note : While an Element can contain another Element, We write the BEM name like this. -->

        <div class="box-2__letter-sealer">

            <span class="box-2__letter"></span>
            <!-- We write the class or id name of the Element's Organazing Block, Rather than the Element, And then connect its name 
            via a double underscore (_) to the Block name. -->
            <!-- Or : Block__box-1 -->
            <!-- And : Block__boxe-words -->
